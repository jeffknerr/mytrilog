# mytrilog
Web app to log triathlon workouts


## based on [The Flask Mega by Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

All of this is just adapted from 
[Miguel's excellent flask tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
The tutorial creates a blogging app. My app changes the blog entries to
workouts, allowing the user to enter workouts and see graphs showing
past workouts.

## still under construction

Not even close to done right now. Still working through the chapters.
Will update this once I have something that works...
